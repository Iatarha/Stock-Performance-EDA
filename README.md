# Stock-Performance-EDA
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis of the performance of stocks of different companies over a period of 5 years. This project utilises popular Python libraries for its exploration. The dataset is quite large; therefore, popular visualization tools like matplotlib yield a very cluttered visual that is difficult to analyze.
