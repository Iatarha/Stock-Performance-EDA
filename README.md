# Stock-Performance-EDA
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis of the stock performance of different companies over a period of 5 years. This project utilises popular Python libraries for its exploration. The dataset is quite large; therefore, popular visualization tools like matplotlib produce very cluttered visuals that are difficult to analyze. The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500?select=individual_stocks_5yr.
